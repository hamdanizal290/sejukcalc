SejukCalc
Project Cooling Load App

1.	About this app
SejukCalc is a practical, easy-to-use mobile app designed to help you calculate the cooling load of a room—perfect for public, students, or anyone working with building ventilation and HVAC systems.
Through a step-by-step input process, SejukCalc guides you to input room dimensions, materials, window and door specifications, internal loads like lighting and equipment, and more. The app then calculates hourly cooling load estimates across a full month and visualizes the results in clear charts and tables.
Whether you're designing an energy-efficient building, verifying room conditions, or just learning about cooling load principles, SejukCalc makes the process easier and more accessible—directly from your phone.


2.	Why SejukCalc

3.	Interface Navigation Flow Overview
At the top of each screen, a title and app icon are displayed for clarity and navigation. The main screen (Index Screen) presents three icon-based buttons that lead to:
  -	Settings Screen
  -	Calculate Screen
  -	Archive Screen
A bottom tab bar also allows users to navigate between these three main screens at any time.
The typical user flow is as follows:
  -	From Calculate Screen, tap the Start button to begin.
  -	The user is guided through five input steps, each collecting different room parameters.
  -	Once complete, the app proceeds to the Result Screen, displaying hourly cooling loads for a month in graphical form.
  -	After reviewing results, the user is directed to the Archive Screen, where previous results are stored.
  -	On the Archive Screen, users can reopen, delete, or export results to PDF format.


4.	Input Layout Overview
